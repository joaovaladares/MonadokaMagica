# MonadokaMagica ðŸŒŸ

A whimsical Haskell playground inspired by the magic of monads and the charm of anime.

## ðŸª„ About the Project

Welcome to MonadokaMagica, a space where I experiment with Haskell, monads, and functional programming concepts. This repository blends the elegance of Haskell with a touch of anime inspiration to make learning and coding more fun and engaging.

## ðŸ“š Features
- Monadic Adventures: Explore the power and utility of monads.
- Functional Paradigms: Dive into functional programming techniques.
- Anime-Inspired Creativity: Coding experiments with a flair for anime aesthetics.

## ðŸŽŒ Why "MonadokaMagica"?

The name is inspired by the anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Haskell's famous monads. It's a playful nod to the magical and elegant world of functional programming.
