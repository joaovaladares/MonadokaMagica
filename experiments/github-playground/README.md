# GitHub Playground 🛠️

Welcome to the GitHub Playground, a collection of self-contained experiments and tools built using the [Haskell GitHub library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/github). 
Each experiment focuses on a specific aspect of interacting with the GitHub API, such as starring repositories, unstarring repositories, and more.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into directories for individual experiments, with shared utilities and dependencies managed at the playground level.
